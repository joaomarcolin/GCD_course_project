# GCD_course_project

This repo was submitted as a part of the Getting and Cleaning Data coursework.

It contains a file with the raw data provided for the assignment, and a script "run_analysis.R" that transforms the raw data in a tidy data set that gives us the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

The repo also contains a code book (code_book.txt) that explains all variables in the tidy_data.csv file.
